Task 3: Image Captioning AI
Project Description
This project, developed as part of the Codsoft Virtual Internship, is an AI-powered application that generates descriptive captions for images. It combines the fields of computer vision and natural language processing to analyze an image and produce a human-like text description. The application features a graphical user interface (GUI) and a slideshow mode for seamless demonstration.

Core Features
AI-Powered Captioning: Uses a pre-trained vision-language model to accurately describe the content of an image.

Random Image Slideshow: Automatically loads and captions a new, random image from a specified dataset at a set interval.

Intuitive GUI: Built with Tkinter to provide a simple and clean user interface.

Technologies Used
Python: The core programming language.

Hugging Face Transformers: Leveraged the BLIP model for state-of-the-art image-to-text generation.

PyTorch: The deep learning framework used by the model.

Pillow (PIL): Used for image loading and processing.

Tkinter: The standard library for building the application's GUI.
